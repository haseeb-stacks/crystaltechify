                                        The first and foremost tip for increasing your rankings is building a strong
                                        backlink strategy. To rank high in the SERPs, you must ask for relevant
                                        backlinks from some authoritative websites out there. Backlinks serve to be one
                                        of the best ways to improve your page ranking. Google awards a website with
                                        higher ranking if they have a high number of backlinks.

                                        Remember the backlinks you have asked for, from these websites must be relevant
                                        and have higher domain authority. In case you have borrowed a link from any low
                                        DA website, you are going to crash soon! Google always counts that link
                                        relevance as your website’s own domain authority. Backlinks are generally
                                        categorized into two main categories:

                                        Natural links refer to those backlinks you get from your organic efforts in
                                        ranking up your website. For instance, if someone visits your website, they love
                                        some content here and want to use it as a reference, the link you’ll get through
                                        this way wll count in as the ‘Natural Link’. Google or all other search engines

                                        authority.

                                        In contrast to natural links, you can improve your backlinks strategy through

                                        On every social platform, there are specific instructions for the content. For
                                        Instagram, images are long gone now. Now, they have switched to the famous
                                        reels. Same goes for Facebook, Twitter (now known as X) or YouTube as well.
                                        Usually, people share content over the main social platforms but neglect Youtube
                                        and Instagram missing some of the biggest opportunities.

                                        For instance, you have written a step-by-step guide for creating a store on
                                        Shopify. By creating a YouTube channel and promoting your content over there,
                                        you can even share the content URP in the description for expanding your content
                                        reach. Visitors from Google thoroughly share their reviews on different content
                                        pieces and try to repurpose the content to boost their overall social networks.
