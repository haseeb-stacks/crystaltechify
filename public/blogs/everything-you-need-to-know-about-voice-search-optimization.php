                                        searches a query with voice search, it appears higher in the search results! The
                                        website content must be clear and to the point so the FAQs are directly answered

                                        The next step is to ensure whatever content or questions you are answering
                                        through your content; people must be looking for them through Google Assistant,

                                        Voice search is trending like never before as it works like having a chit-chat
                                        with some other member sitting right in front of you! People casually search
                                        different things in a conversational tone as interacting with users is
                                        super-easy this way.
                                        For instance, a person is looking for the best breakfast restaurants available
                                        in the middle of driving. Suppose he asks, “What’s the nearest breakfast
                                        restaurant that’s open right now?” In contrast, if he’s searching with text
                                        search, he would write a few words like: “Breakfast restaurants open now.”
                                        But how will you define whether you must optimize your content according to the
                                        traditional SEO techniques or voice search tricks would fit it best! Here are
                                        some of the secrets:

                                </div>
                                <div class=" blog-card-two__content--two">

                                        In contrast to text searches, voice searches are usually longer. In text form,
                                        only a few words are targeted. On the other hand, in voice search, it's easier
                                        to speak and ask any question. For instance: Instead of typing weather New York
                                        today, you can always voice search it as, “How’s the New York weather today?”
                                        With voice search, it’s easier to target the audience with long-tail keywords,
                                        and phrases with questions tend to appear in snippets.

                                        In voice search, only a few results appear. With text search, it's easier as
                                        there are multiple answers/results to your searched query. This way, there is an
                                        easy way to rank with more featured snippets or FAQs in your content.

                                        When users conduct voice searches, they often have clear intentions and require

                                        answering potential questions, highly important. Text searches, on the other
                                        hand, allow users to gather a more diverse range of information since they can
                                        explore a variety of content types.

                                            use a conversational tone. As users interact with voice assistants such as
                                            Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, the design reflects how they use these

                                        Long-tail keywords are usually for searching long queries. Although these
                                        keywords have low volume, still, when you use these with a combination of
                                        different words, it becomes easier to target quite many things with a single
                                        long tail keyword.
                                        It’s quite easy to use these keywords to search any query. Long tail keywords
                                        usually help to drive some action, like asking the audience to sign up for your
                                        newsletter or purchase your product. With long-tail keywords, you can increase
                                        the chances of conversions by targeting the less competitive terms.
                                        Let's make it more clear with an example: There is so much difference in
                                        searching for the term “shoe” as compared to that of “best shoe place near me.”
                                        In the first search results, you’ll get the basic information about any
                                        service/product you are looking for. By looking for a product near me, you are
                                        igniting some kind of purchasing decision.
                                        That’s why, when you focus on long-tail keywords, it just broadens your ways to
                                        a more specific action-driven result. Thinking about how these targeted keywords
                                        appear in the search results?
                                        In voice search, most of the questions that appear at the top of search results
                                        include enriched keywords. There is a wide range of tools available out there,
                                        including Ahrefs, Answer the Public, Keywords Explorer, and SEMrush Keyword
                                        Magic Tool, that help you determine what your audience is looking for currently
                                        and how you can target those queries.
                                        Apart from these specific tools, taking questions and including them in your SEO
                                        results also include the “People Also Ask” section on the Google SERP. Remember,
                                        when you are targeting your audience with the content, make sure to use a
                                        conversational tone and include the keywords naturally in your content.
                                        Adding questionable terms like; “who,” “what,” “where,” “when,” “why” and “how”
                                        play a key role in improving your content intent, ultimately leading to rank
                                        higher in the search results. Carefully analyze your content approach and make
                                        it fit according to your users’ preferences to upgrade the content relevance and
                                        engagement.

                                        mobile and iOS devices. Having an optimal and efficient user experience plays a

                                        Mobile-friendly websites are a step ahead in the race of ranking both for text
                                        searches and voice search optimization. The reason is that mobile traffic is
                                        greater than desktops globally. You can improve the website load time by not
                                        zooming in the text on mobile phones. Remember there must not be any kind of
